# Phased-Array-Simulator
This project implements a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization framework for designing and optimizing satellite antenna array configurations. The code is designed to generate, simulate, and evolve phased array antenna configurations to maximize a reward function based on signal coverage and power efficiency.
